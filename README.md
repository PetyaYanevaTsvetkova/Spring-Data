## Project's Title:
	JDBC: Mapping data to POJOs

## Project Description:
	Spring Data Story

	Theory:
	Spring Framework - a platform for developing software applications, may include code libraries, a compiler, and other programs used in the software development process
	Spring Boot
	Spring Data
	Spring Data Repositories
	Spring Data Query Creation
	Spring Data Services
	Spring Annotations:
	@Component - tells Spring to manage this class for us
	@Configuration
	@Bean
	@Service
	@Repository
	@Autowired - сладаме само на този конструктор, за който искаме да ни се инстанцират елементите в него. Ако имаме само един конструктор, тази анотация не ни е нужна
	@MappedSuperclass - to be inherited correctly from other classes
	@Entity
	@Table 
	Relationships in Spring: 
	@OneToOne 
	@OneToMany  
	@ManyToMany
	JPA/Hibernate Cascade Types(in OneToMany associations, we've mentioned cascade type in the annotation)
	Gson
	Validation/Package javax.validation.constraints
	IoC container


	Practical Task:

	Setup Spring Project:
	Using Intellij idea community version: https://start.spring.io/
	Add dependencies:
		-> Spring Data JPA
		-> PostgreSQL Driver 
	Export .jip and open project
	Hint: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-data-jpa-column-annotation/

	Create Database by Code First Approach with Spring Framework:

	Customer <-> Address (Many to One  relationship)
	Customer - > Orders (One to Many  relationship)
	Orders <-> Products (Many to Many  relationship)


	Customer Table:
	Id Long, Not Null, Auto Increment
	First name, Not Null
	Last name, Not Null
	Age, Integer (1-100)
	Emai, Unique, Not Null
	Phone, Not Null, 
	Consent_status, Boolean,  Not Null
	Is_profile_active Boolean,  Not Null
	Date_profile_created, LocalDate, Not Null
	Date_profile_deactivated, LocalDate
	Reason_for_deactivation, String
	notes TEXT, max 200 characters
	Address_id (FOREIGN KEY)
	Set<Orders> orders

	Address Table:
	Id Long, Not Null, Auto Increment
	Postal Code, Integer, positive number
	Address, String
	City, String Not Null
	Country, String, Not Null 
	Set<Customer>

	Product Table:
	Id Long, Not Null, Auto Increment
	Name, String, Not Null
	Quantity, Integer, Not Null, Positive number
	Type, String, Not Null
	Price, BigDecimal, Not Nul, Positivel
	Is the product in Stock, Boolean, Not Null
	Warehouse, String, Not Null

	Orders Table:
	Id Long, Not Null, Auto Increment
	Is Order Completed, Boolean, Not Null
	Is Order Paid, Boolean, Not Null
	Date of Order, LocalDate, Not Null
	Date Order Completed, LocalDate
	Customer_id, Not Null (FOREIGN KEY)
	Set<Product> products

	Fill the information in the tables with the information from the attached JSON files
